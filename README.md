# iTop-TeemIP-Extension
Some fixes to make my modules TeemIP compatible

## Motivation

I'm currently trying TeemIP over a heavily customized iTop. As TeemIP change somewhat de datamodel, It cannot do changes to my own extension ! In praticular, TeemIP remove the managementip field, so some of my extensions are unhappy.
